The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive and transparent description
of the features of the OpenQuake-engine (v1.2). This book is designed to be 
readable by someone with basic understanding of Probabilistic Seismic Hazard 
and Risk Analysis, but no previous knowledge of the OpenQuake-engine is assumed.

The OpenQuake-engine is an effort promoted and actively developed by the
Global Earthquake Model, a public-private partnership initiated by the Global
Science Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD)\footnote{A short description of the process promoted by OECD is available 
here http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/theglobalearthquakemodelgem.htm}.

The OpenQuake-engine is the result of an effort carried out jointly by the
Information Technology and Scientific teams working at the GEM Secretariat.
