The single asset test cases are designed to test the basic elements of the scenario risk calculator, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item basic loss field computation
\item calculation of mean and standard deviation of scenario loss
\end{itemize}

The location and taxonomy of the single asset in the exposure model used for the single-asset test cases for the scenario risk calculator are given in Table \ref{tab:asset}.

The hazard computation for the scenario risk calculator is identical for all test cases. One thousand ground motion fields are generated for the given rupture, taking into consideration both the inter-event and intra-event variability in the ground motion. The ground motion prediction equation used is Boore and Atkinson (2008).

\input{qareport/tab-scenario-gmfs-single}

Table \ref{tab:scenario-gmfs-single} lists five of the thousand ground motion values generated.
