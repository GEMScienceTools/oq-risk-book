The single asset test cases are designed to test the basic elements of the event-based risk calculator, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item asset event loss table computation
\item asset loss ratio exceedance curve computation
\item asset loss exceedance curve computation
\end{itemize}

The location and taxonomy of the single asset in the exposure model used for the single-asset test cases for the event-based risk calculator are given in Table \ref{tab:asset}.
