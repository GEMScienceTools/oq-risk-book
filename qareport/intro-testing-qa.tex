Despite the distinction between software testing (in some cases also called Quality Control) and \gls{acr:sqa} being somewhat vague and partly open to personal judgment, it's clear that \gls{acr:sqa} is a more comprehensive and overarching process than software testing.
%
\gls{acr:sqa} aims at the definition of the best processes that should be used to provide guarantees that user expectations will be met.
%
Software testing focuses instead on detecting software faults by inspecting and testing the product at different stages of development.

\subsection{Software testing}
Software testing can be implemented at different stages of the development process, with varying strategies to approach the problem.
%
The \gls{acr:oqe} and the associated libraries are developed following an agile paradigm. This development strategy is organized in a way that the creation of the real code is completed in parallel and fully integrated with the software testing process.

The software engineering community provides a wide range of testing levels
and typologies. In the current document we consider just a portion of them
with the specific intent to illustrate the standards used in the development of the \gls{acr:oqe} and particularly of its risk calculation component.

\subsection{Quality assurance}
From the IEEE ``Standard for Software Quality Assurance Processes'':
\emph{Software quality assurance is a set of activities that define and assess the adequacy of software processes to provide evidence that establishes confidence that the software processes are appropriate for and produce software products of suitable quality for their intended purposes. A key attribute of SQA is the objectivity of the SQA function with respect to the project. The SQA function may also be organizationally independent of the project; that is, free from technical, managerial, and financial pressures from the project.} In this document we are not covering topics related to \gls{acr:sqa} since this would go beyond its scope.
