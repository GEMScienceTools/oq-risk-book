The classical PSHA-based risk calculator convolves through numerical integration, the probabilistic vulnerability functions for an asset with the seismic hazard curve at the location of the asset, to give the loss distribution for the asset within a specified time period. The calculator requires the definition of an exposure model, a vulnerability model for each loss type of interest with vulnerability functions for each taxonomy represented in the exposure model, and hazard curves calculated in the region of interest. Loss curves and loss maps can currently be calculated for five different loss types using this calculator: structural losses, nonstructural losses, contents losses, downtime losses, and occupant fatalities. The main results of this calculator are loss exceedance curves for each asset, which describe the probability of exceedance of different loss levels over the specified time period, and loss maps for the region, which describe the loss values that have a given probability of exceedance over the specified time period.

The hazard curves required for this calculator can be calculated by the OpenQuake engine for all asset locations in the exposure model using the classical PSHA approach \citep{cornell1968, mcguire1976}. The use of logic-trees allows for the consideration of model uncertainty in the choice of a ground motion prediction equation for the different tectonic region types in the region.

Given this set of functionalities, the acceptance testing framework for the classical PSHA-based risk calculator is divided into the following three test sets:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single asset test cases
	\item Multiple asset test cases
	\item Logic-tree test cases
\end{enumerate}

The individual test cases are described in more detail in \ref{sec:acc-cr}.
