\section{Verification Framework}
The main purpose of the acceptance tests is to ensure that the risk calculators work according to the design specifications and to verify that the calculators produce correct results for a variety of input cases. Correctness of the test case results are verified by comparing with hand calculations for the simple test cases or with alternate implementaions in Julia for the complex cases.
