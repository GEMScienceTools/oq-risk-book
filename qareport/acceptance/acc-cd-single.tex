The single asset test cases are designed to test the basic elements of the classical-PSHA based damage calculator, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item damage state occurrence probabilities for assets
\end{itemize}

The location and taxonomy of the single asset in the exposure model used for the single-asset test cases for the classical damage calculator are given in Table~\ref{tab:asset}.
