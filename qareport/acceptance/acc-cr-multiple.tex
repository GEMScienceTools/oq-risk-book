The multiple asset test cases are designed to test the correct working of the classical risk calculator for a portfolio of assets of different taxonomies. The vulnerability functions for the different taxonomies are based on different intensity measure types.

The list of assets in the exposure model used for the multiple-asset test cases for the classical risk calculator is given in Table \ref{tab:assets-tax3}.
