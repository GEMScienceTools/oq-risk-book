Test Case~1c repeats the exercise from Case~1a, with the difference that the discrete fragility function specifies a minimum ground motion intensity, below which the probability of exceedance for all damage states is assumed to be zero.

Table~\ref{tab:ff-disc-tax1-zndl} shows the discrete fragility function used in this test case. The "no damage limit" is specified to be $0.3 g$. The procedure used for calculating the damage state probabilities remains the same as described in Case~1a, apart from this modification to the "no damage limit".
