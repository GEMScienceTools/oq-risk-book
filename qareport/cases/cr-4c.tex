This case tests the computation of the loss exceedance curve and average annual loss when the value of the assets is specified per unit area, and the aggregate area of each asset is provided in the exposure model. The vulnerability function used is the same as in Case~1c and shown in Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-nzcov}. The asset has an aggregate area of $1,000$ sq. units, and the value per unit area is $5$. The aggregate asset value in this case is $5,000$. The average annual loss in this case should be exactly half the value calculated in Case~1c.
