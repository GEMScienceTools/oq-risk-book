Ten thousand ground motion fields are generated for the given rupture, taking into consideration both the inter-event and intra-event variability in the ground motion. The ground motion prediction equation used is Boore and Atkinson (2008), and the Jayaram and Baker (2009) model for spatial correlation of ground motion values is applied.

The list of assets in the exposure model used for the test cases involving asset correlation (Cases 4b, 4c, and 4d) is given in Table~\ref{tab:assets-tax1}.

\input{qareport/tables/tab-gmfs-sim-l7-10000}

Table~\ref{tab:gmfs-sim-l7-10000} lists five of the ten thousand ground motion fields generated by the OpenQuake scenario hazard calculator.

For the calculation using Julia, one million ground motion fields are similarly generated.
