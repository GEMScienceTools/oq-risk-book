The purpose of this case is to test the computation of the loss exceedance probabilities when the time period associated with the loss curve calculation is different from the time period associated with the hazard curve calculation. In this case, the hazard curve is calculated for a time period of 50 years, and the loss curve is calculated for a time period of 75 years. The procedure used for calculating the damage state probabilities remains the same as described in Case~1a, except that the values for the parameters $t_H$ and $t_R$ used in the equations to convert probabilities to frequencies and vice versa are $50 yr$ and $75 yr$ respectively in this case, whereas both parameters were set to $1 yr$ in Case~1a.
