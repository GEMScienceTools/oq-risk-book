This test case is identical to Case~1a described above, except for the use of the Beta CDF for the vulnerability functions instead of the lognormal CDF. Since the coefficients of variation in the vulnerability function are all zero, once again the Beta distribution devolves into the degenerate distribution as in the previous case. The results for this test case should be exactly the same as in Case~1a.
