The list of assets in the exposure model used in this case is given in Table~\ref{tab:assets-tax3}. As shown in the table, the assets fall into three different taxonomies. Table~\ref{tab:ff-cont-tax3-zmin} shows the parameters for the continuous lognormal fragility functions for the three taxonomies. Seven hazard curves are computed, one each for the seven sites. The procedure used for calculating the damage state probabilities for each of the seven individual assets remains the same as described in Case~1b, with the appropriate fragility function used for each asset depending on its assigned taxonomy.
