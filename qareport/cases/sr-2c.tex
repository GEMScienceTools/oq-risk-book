The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of mean and standard deviation of downtime, or business-interruption losses for an asset. The loss due to downtime, or business-interruption for the asset used in this case is $2,000 / month$. Downtime losses are usually specified per unit time the asset will be unavailable for occupancy or use. Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-dnt} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation for the downtime vulnerability function used in this test case.
