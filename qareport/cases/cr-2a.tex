In addition to computing direct structural losses, OpenQuake also provides support for computing losses incurred for the following other loss types:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Non-structural losses}
\item{Contents losses}
\item{Downtime, or business interruption losses}
\item{Occupant fatalities}
\end{itemize}

The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of the loss exceedance curve and average annual loss for the non-structural components of an asset. The replacement value of the non-structural components for the asset used in this case is $15,000$. Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-nst} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation for the non-structural components vulnerability model used in this test case.
