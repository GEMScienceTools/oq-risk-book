Test Case~1d repeats the exercise from Case~1b, with the difference that the continuous fragility function specifies a minimum ground motion intensity, below which the probability of exceedance for all damage states is assumed to be zero.

Table~\ref{tab:ff-cont-tax1-zmin} shows the continuous fragility function used in this test case. The "minimum intensity level" is specified to be $0.3 g$. The procedure used for calculating the damage state probabilities remains the same as described in Case~1b, apart from this modification to the "no damage limit".
