The purpose of this case is to test the basic elements of a classical risk calculation involving multiple assets, such as the computation of the loss exceedance curve and average annual loss for each asset in a portfolio of assets.

The list of assets and their taxonomies are shown in Table~\ref{tab:assets-tax3}. The calculation of the loss curve and average annual loss for each of the seven assets follows the same procedure as described in Case~1c, and is not repeated here.
