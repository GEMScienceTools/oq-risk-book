The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of mean and standard deviation of occupant fatalities for an asset. The number of occupants for the asset used in this case are 2 (day), 4 (transit), and 6 (night). Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-dnt} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation for the occupants fatality vulnerability function used in this test case.
