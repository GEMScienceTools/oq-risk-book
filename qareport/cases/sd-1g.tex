Case~1g is designed to test a simple multiplication of the mean and standard deviation of damage state probabilities by the number of units comprising an asset. When an asset comprises more than one unit, the Scenario Damage calculator returns the expected fraction of buildings in each damage state, and the corresponding standard deviation. This case is thus designed identical to Case~1f, except that the single asset used in this case comprises three units, instead of one as in the previous case. The expected results should be three times those obtained in Case~1f.
