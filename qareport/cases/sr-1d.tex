This test case is identical to Case~1c described above, except for the use of the Beta CDF for the probabilistic fistribution of the vulnerability functions instead of the lognormal CDF.

Table~\ref{tab:vf-bt-tax1-nzcov} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation in the vulnerability function used in this test case. The same one thousand identical ground motion values described earlier in Table~\ref{tab:gmfs-iden-l1-1000} are used in this test case.

Since the mean loss ratios at the different intensity measure levels and the corresponding coefficients of variation in the vulnerability function are exactly the same as in Case~1c, the results for this test case should also be exactly the same as in Case~1c.
