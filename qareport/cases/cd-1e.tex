This test case repeats the exercise from Case~1a using a discrete fragility model (Table~\ref{tab:ff-disc-tax1-zndl}) with a zero "no damage limit", and using four `steps\_per\_interval'. Each interval between the intensity levels specified in the fragility model is further divided into four equal subdivisions, thus ensuring a greater number of intensity levels at which the hazard curve will be computed. The procedure used for calculating the damage state probabilities remains the same as described in Case~1a, apart from this modification to the "steps\_per\_interval" interpolation parameter.
