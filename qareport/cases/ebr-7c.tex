This case is designed to exercise the portfolio insured loss exceedance curve computation for an exposure model containing multiple assets. In this case, the vulnerability models of different assets of the same taxonomy are treated as fully correlated. In OpenQuake, this can be specified in the job configuration file, by setting the value of the parameter `asset\_correlation' to one.

The sampling of the loss ratios proceeds as described earlier in Case~6c, and the insured losses for the individual assets are obtained from the asset event loss tables as described in Case~7a. Apart from the individual asset insured loss exceedance curves, in this case, the portfolio insured loss exceedance curve is also computed. Finally, the average portfolio insured loss is computed as the area under the portfolio insured loss exceedance curve.
