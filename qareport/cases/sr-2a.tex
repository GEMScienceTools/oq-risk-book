In addition to computing direct structural losses, OpenQuake also provides support for computing losses incurred for the following other loss types:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Non-structural losses}
\item{Contents losses}
\item{Downtime, or business interruption losses}
\item{Occupant fatalities}
\end{itemize}

\input{qareport/tables/tab-vf-ln-tax1-occ}

The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of mean and standard deviation of non-structural losses for an asset. The replacement value of the non-structural components for the asset used in this case is $15,000$. Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-nst} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation in the non-structural components vulnerability function used in this test case.
