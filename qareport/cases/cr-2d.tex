The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of the exceedance curve for fatalities and the average annual occupant fatalities for an asset. The number of occupants for the asset used in this case are 2 (day), 4 (transit), and 6 (night). An average value of 4 occupants is used for the calculation of the exceedance curve and average annual fatalities. Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-dnt} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation for the occupants fatality vulnerability function used in this test case.
