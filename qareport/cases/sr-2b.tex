The purpose of this case is to test the calculation of mean and standard deviation of the contents losses for an asset. The replacement value of the contents for the asset used in this case is $5,000$. Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-con} shows the mean loss ratios and corresponding coefficients of variation in the contents vulnerability function used in this test case.
