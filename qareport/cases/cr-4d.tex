This case tests the computation of the loss exceedance curve and average annual loss when the value of the assets is specified per unit area, the area is specified per unit, and the number of units in each asset are provided in the exposure model. The vulnerability function used is the same as in Case~1c and shown in Table~\ref{tab:vf-ln-tax1-nzcov}. The asset has three units, the area per unit is $400$ sq. units, and the value per unit area is $10$. The aggregate asset value in this case is $12,000$.
