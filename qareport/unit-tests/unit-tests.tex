This chapter provides an introduction to the module (unit) testing procedures \citep{myers2012} and describes the estensive series of tests implemented in the \gls{acr:oqe}. Several portions of the following sections are reproduced from \citet{pagani2014_oqtesting}, as they describe the common unit-testing procedures employed in both the hazard and risk components of the OpenQuake-engine.
