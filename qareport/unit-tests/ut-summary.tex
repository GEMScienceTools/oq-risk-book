In this chapter we have outlined both the process and the key benefits of developing comprehensive unit-tests for OpenQuake-engine, as well as outlining the operation of the continuous integration system, which should ensure that code with the potential to break the tests cannot be packaged and released. The unit-tests themselves have not been discussed in detail as nearly one thousand tests are executed during the unit-test process. However, to view the comprehensive set of tests, the reader is encouraged to refer to the full test-suite, which is open and available on the OpenQuake code repository (\href{https://github.com/gem/oq-risklib/tree/master/openquake/risklib/tests}
{https://github.com/gem/oq-risklib/tree/master/openquake/risklib/tests}).
